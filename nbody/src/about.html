Quick help:
 - add planets by double clicking;
   then click to place a velocity vector
 - modify planet properties at any time
   from the side panel (try it!)
 - remove planets by clicking "remove planet"
 
Known issues:
 - numerical integration is (by definition)
   inaccurate, and if planets experience
   extreme accelerations, they escape
 - about dialog is a work in progress
