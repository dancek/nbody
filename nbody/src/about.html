<h1>Quick help:</h1>
<ul>
<li>add planets by double clicking;
   then click to place a velocity vector</li>
<li>choose a planet by clicking on it or from the listbox or by clicking "next planet"</li>
<li>modify planet and view properties at any time
   from the side panel (try clicking everything!)</li>
<li>remove planets by clicking "remove planet"</li>
<li>move view around by dragging background</li>
<li>zoom by using scrollwheel (zooms where
   you point a la Google Maps)</li>
<li>the direction is to the east when the
   slider is at zero; it increases counter-clockwise</li>
<li>you can set the default mass for new planets by setting the mass in the mass text box and pressing return</li>
</ul>

<h1>Known issues / non-issues:</h1>
<ul>
<li>numerical integration is (by definition) inaccurate, and if planets experience extreme accelerations, they escape</li>
<li>load and save can't be used with web start</li>
<li>direction as a slider from 0 to 2*pi is unintuitive (but this arrangement is the best I could come up with; dividing velocity into components would be less useful)</li>
<li>there's no collision detection (on purpose; it'd be stupid since the planets are drawn way bigger than they'd actually be)</li>
<li>the app isn't very usable at small resolutions since the side panel takes some space</li>
</ul>

<h1>Possible upcoming features</h1>
<ul>
<li>stabilizing orbits by changing mass or velocity</li>
<li>a collection of interesting worlds to be distributed with nbody</li>
<li>textured planets (easy, but I'd need to make the textures)</li>
</ul>
