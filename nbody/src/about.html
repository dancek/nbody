<h1>Quick help:</h1>
<ul>
<li>add planets by double clicking;
   then click to place a velocity vector</li>
<li>modify planet properties at any time
   from the side panel (try it!)</li>
<li>remove planets by clicking "remove planet"</li>
<li>move view around by dragging background</li>
<li>zoom by using scrollwheel (zooms where
   you point a la Google Maps)</li>
<li>the direction is to the east when the
   slider is at zero; it increases counter-clockwise</li>
<li>you can set the default mass for new planets by setting the mass in the mass text box and pressing return</li>
</ul>

<h1>Known issues:</h1>
<ul>
<li>numerical integration is (by definition)
   inaccurate, and if planets experience
   extreme accelerations, they escape</li>
<li>direction as a slider from 0 to 2*pi is
   unintuitive; however, I wanted to also
   show the linear velocity and couldn't
   come up with a better arrangement</li>
<li>the app isn't very usable at small resolutions since the side panel takes some space</li>
</ul>
